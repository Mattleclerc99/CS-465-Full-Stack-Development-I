# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development-I

In the project, I have performed two types of frontend developments: server-rendered HTML with JavaScript via Express and a dynamic single-page application with Angular. Express allowed me to serve static pages fast and easily integrate them with the back-end routes, suitable for simple data displays. On the other hand, this SPA in Angular provided more interactive experience since there was smooth navigation through the pages which could update dynamically without full reloads. The component-based structure of Angular also allowed me to reuse UI elements and streamline my code, making the frontend more modular and maintainable.

On the other hand, for the actual backend, I used MongoDB due to its ease associated with NoSQL, apart from having a document-style JSON-like structure, making interfacing with JavaScript really smooth and simple. MongoDB's Dynamic Schema let me effectively focus on the data that might not need to get worked out with rigid structures involved. In addition, interactions between the frontend and backend were made simpler since the potential existed to store and restore data in a form with conformance to my returned API responses.

Heavy utilization of JSON tied the front-end and back-end together. Unlike JavaScript, JSON does not contain functions nor implement any logic; it's a lightweight data format for storing and transferring data. JSON was used in the project to send HTTP requests from the Angular frontend to the Express backend, wherein the backend processed the requests and returned JSON data back to the client. For example, in the process of adding or editing the trips, the frontend sends form data in JSON format; the backend confirms or gives error messages. I refactored code throughout this process to improve functionality. For example, one example is to centralize error handling for API calls, making the backend more efficient and readable. Besides that, reutilization of common Angular components, like forms for adding, editing, and deleting trips, helped to maintain the page's look and feel cohesive.

Testing this project was all over an important part of the project, which it was to be made sure that everything at the endpoint worked properly. I applied such HTTP methods as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which corresponded to Create, Read, Update, and Delete, accordingly; all of them I was testing by hand using Postman.

With added JWT authentication for protected routes, testing got more complex as it became required for me to include Bearer tokens into request headers and check for proper access. A very good example here would be update or delete endpoints on a trip record; here, a token would prove valid for operations, confirming the owner alone had taken it. This made me deeper understand how methods, endpoints, and security together can be used within one full-stack application. 

This course has helped me to gain confidence in my ability to build and debug full-stack applications. I learned how to implement robust backend APIs, design interactive frontends using Angular, and connect the two seamlessly with tools like MongoDB and JWT authentication. The challenges I faced, such as fixing routing issues, handling security layers, and debugging API errors, strengthened my problem-solving skills. I feel more confident about solving real-world development challenges and believe that the combination of these skills makes me a stronger, more marketable candidate in my career field.
